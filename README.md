Neural Unsupervised Style Transfer based on Multiple-Attribute Text Rewriting - ICLR 2019 (https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1g2NhC5KQ). Latent representation pooling is not implemented in this version. Additionally, a new loss from the classifier is added which gives the model more ability to control style.

Tested this model on PASTEL and Yelp dataset which needs to put in the Data folder in the same directory as the Code folder.

TODO:

1) Add a language model loss.
2) Implement latent representation pooling.
